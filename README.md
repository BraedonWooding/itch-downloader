### Commands

List all your purchased games:

```bash
# List all games
itch-downloader ls

# List games with API key
itch-downloader ls --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Filter by author
itch-downloader ls --author "Supergiant Games"

# Filter by title (contains match)
itch-downloader ls --title "puzzle"

# Combine filters
itch-downloader ls --author "indie" --title "adventure"
```

#### Download Games (`dl`)

Download your purchased games:

```bash
# Download all games
itch-downloader dl

# Download to specific directory
itch-downloader dl --output ./my-games

- Progress for fetching your game library
- Individual progress bars for each download
- Extraction progress when using `--unzip`
- Summary of completed downloads

## File Organization

When using the `--unzip` option, games are organized as follows:
```
output-directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game Title 1/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game Title 2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extracted files...
